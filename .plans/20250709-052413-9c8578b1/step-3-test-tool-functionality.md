# Step 3: Test Tool Functionality

**Plan**: 20250709-052413-9c8578b1
**Status**: Completed
**Started**: 2025-07-09T05:24:18Z
**Completed**: 2025-07-09T05:24:20Z
**Duration**: 2.70 seconds

## Goal
Use the list of projects to confirm retrieval of data and validate tool schema

## Execution Details
- **Server**: 
- **Tool**: 
- **Prompt**: Verify the schema of all retrieved projects from Azure DevOps

## Actual Outputs
```json
{
  "ai_tool_selection_response": "To verify the schema of all retrieved projects from Azure DevOps, I need to ensure that the data from Step 2 contains the necessary project information. Based on the provided results:\n\n- The retrieved projects are:\n  1. **public**\n  2. **internal**\n  3. **1ESPipelineTemplates**\n\nSince the user wants to verify the schema of all retrieved projects, there is no direct tool provided in the list to perform schema verification. The tools available are mainly for retrieving additional information about repositories, pull requests, or work items.\n\nGiven that this task does not align with the functionality of any listed tools, I cannot proceed with a specific tool. If you need further clarification or assistance with a specific Azure DevOps operation, let me know.\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
  "raw_result": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
  "parsed_results": {
    "raw_text": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
    "parse_error": "\u0027A\u0027 is an invalid start of a value. Path: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 1."
  }
}
