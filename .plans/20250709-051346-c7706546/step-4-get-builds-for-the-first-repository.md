However, the parsed data does not explicitly provide the repository list, but it does mention projects. Extracting from Step 2 Parsed Data, the first project has the following details:\n\n- Project Name: \u0060public\u0060\n- Project ID: \u00609ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d\u0060\n\nThe repositories themselves are not explicitly listed in the available data. Since the required repository information cannot be extracted from the data provided, I cannot proceed with the request.\n\nHere is the response:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
  "raw_result": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
