## Goal

## Execution Details
- **Server**: 
- **Tool**: 
- **Prompt**: Get all builds for the first repository from the list of repositories retrieved

## Actual Outputs
```json
{
  "ai_tool_selection_response": "To retrieve all builds for the first repository from the list of repositories, we need the project name and repository details. Based on the parsed data:\n\n1. Step 2 contains repository details, and the first repository in the list has the following properties:\n   - Name: \u0022public\u0022\n   - Id: \u00229ee6d478-d288-47f7-aacc-f6e6d082ae6d\u0022\n\n2. Step 3 indicates that a project name is required, but it does not provide the project name explicitly. The project name must be extracted from Step 2\u0027s context. Unfortunately, the project name is not provided directly within Step 2 or Step 3 parsed data.\n\nSince the project name is missing and is required for the tool to function, I cannot proceed with the request. Here is the response:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
  "raw_result": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
  "parsed_results": {
    "raw_text": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
    "parse_error": "\u0027A\u0027 is an invalid start of a value. Path: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 1."
  }
