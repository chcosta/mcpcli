**Plan**: 20250709-051230-1a7166b4
**Status**: Completed
**Started**: 2025-07-09T05:12:36Z
**Completed**: 2025-07-09T05:12:40Z
**Duration**: 3.99 seconds

## Goal
Organize the subtasks into a sequential order based on dependencies and logical flow

## Execution Details
- **Server**: 
- **Tool**: 
- **Prompt**: Create a sequence of steps where each step depends on the outputs of the previous steps and follows a logical order

## Actual Outputs
```json
{
  "ai_tool_selection_response": "Given the previous steps, the only relevant data extracted is that Azure DevOps was successfully connected and three projects were found. However, the specific project names or any other relevant parameters required to utilize the tools are not provided.\n\nSince the parsed data from Step 2 indicates a parsing error and does not provide usable information, and Step 1 does not specify the names of the three projects found, I am unable to extract the required parameters to proceed with any tool usage.\n\nHere is the response:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
  "raw_result": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
  "parsed_results": {
    "raw_text": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
    "parse_error": "\u0027A\u0027 is an invalid start of a value. Path: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 1."
  }
}
