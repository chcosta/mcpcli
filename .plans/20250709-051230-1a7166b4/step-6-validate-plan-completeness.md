## Goal

## Execution Details
- **Server**: 
- **Tool**: 
- **Prompt**: Validate that the execution plan covers every part of the user's request and does not omit any essential steps

## Actual Outputs
```json
{
  "ai_tool_selection_response": "Based on the analysis of the previous step results, there is insufficient data available to extract specific parameter values (such as project names, repository names, dates, etc.) for the user\u0027s request. The parsed data from Steps 2-5 indicates errors or incomplete results, while Step 1 contains only a general message about successfully connecting to Azure DevOps and finding 3 projects, but does not provide actual project names or other actionable details.\n\nSince no actionable parameters can be extracted, I cannot proceed with selecting a tool or providing parameters.\n\nHere is the response:\n\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060",
  "raw_result": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
  "parsed_results": {
    "raw_text": "[AI did not select a tool for this prompt]",
    "parse_error": "\u0027A\u0027 is an invalid start of a value. Path: $ | LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 1."
  }
}
