**Created**: 2025-07-09T05:12:30Z
**Status**: InProgress

## Steps

- Step 1: Analyze the user's request to identify all components, objectives, and requirements that need to be addressed
- Step 2: Divide the request into a sequence of subtasks that are necessary to fully accomplish the user's goal
- Step 3: Create a sequence of steps where each step depends on the outputs of the previous steps and follows a logical order
- Step 4: Identify subtasks that are independent of each other and can be executed in parallel
- Step 5: Write natural language prompts for each step that describe exactly what needs to be done
- Step 6: Validate that the execution plan covers every part of the user's request and does not omit any essential steps
